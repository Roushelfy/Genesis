class Shell(Material["ShellEntity"]):
    """
    A thin elastoplastic sheet that can tear and crack, simulated by the shell solver.

    The sheet is a triangle mesh resisting in-plane stretching (membrane) and out-of-plane bending (hinges). Its
    material yields plastically past a stress or curvature threshold, and it fractures at a vertex whose surrounding
    stress exceeds the tensile strength: the vertex splits along the existing mesh edge that relieves the most stress,
    so the crack paths follow the mesh edges.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rho : float, optional
        Volumetric density, in kg/m^3. The mass of a triangle is rho * thickness * area. Default is 1000.
    E : float, optional
        Young's modulus, in Pa. Default is 1e6.
    nu : float, optional
        Poisson's ratio, in [0, 0.5). Default is 0.3.
    thickness : float, optional
        Thickness of the sheet, in m. It scales the membrane stiffness linearly and the bending stiffness cubically.
        Default is 1e-3.
    bending_scale : float, optional
        Multiplier of the bending stiffness of an isotropic plate, for sheets whose bending is softer (paper fibers,
        knits) or stiffer (rolled metal) than their stretching suggests. Default is 1.0.
    damping : float, optional
        Stiffness-proportional damping, in seconds. Larger values dissipate the vibration of stiff sheets faster at the
        cost of a slower, more viscous motion. Default is 0.0.
    tensile_strength : float or None, optional
        Stress at which the material fails, in Pa. A lower value fails more easily. The sheet reports its damage index,
        the largest principal stress of its two outer surfaces over this strength, which reaches one where it fails
        (see `ShellEntity.get_faces_damage`). None disables damage and fracture. Default is None.
    fracture : bool, optional
        Whether the sheet tears where it fails, splitting its vertices along the mesh edges. Tearing changes the mesh
        of every environment independently and reserves vertex slots for it (see `ShellOptions.fracture_capacity`).
        False keeps the mesh intact and only reports the damage and the first failure, which costs less memory and
        compute and suits an episode that ends at the first failure. Default is True.
    bending_fracture_scale : float, optional
        Weight of the bending strain in the fracture criterion. 1.0 treats the outer layer of a bent sheet as the
        stressed one, which makes brittle sheets (glass, ceramics) crack under bending. 0.0 makes the sheet tear under
        stretching alone, as paper does. Default is 1.0.
    yield_stress : float or None, optional
        Von Mises stress past which the sheet stretches plastically, in Pa. Plastic stretching also thins the sheet,
        conserving its volume. None disables stretching plasticity. Default is None.
    plastic_flow_rate : float, optional
        Rate at which the plastic stretching absorbs the stress above the yield stress, in 1/s. A higher value makes
        the yielding faster and closer to perfect plasticity, a lower one makes the sheet creep. Default is 100.
    yield_curvature : float or None, optional
        Curvature past which the sheet bends plastically, in 1/m. A creased sheet keeps its folds. None disables
        bending plasticity. Default is None.
